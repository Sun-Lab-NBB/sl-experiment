    file.

    This is a worker function called by the process_mesoscope_directory in-parallel for each stack inside each
    processed directory. It re-compresses the input TIFF stack using LERC-compression and extracts the frame-variant
    ScanImage metadata for each frame inside the stack. Optionally, the function can be configured to verify data
    integrity after compression and to remove original TIFF stacks after processing.

    Notes:
        This function can reserve up to double the processed stack size of RAM bytes to hold the data in memory. If the
        host-computer does not have enough RAM, reduce the number of concurrent processes or disable verification.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If any extracted frame does not match the original frame stored inside the TIFF stack.
        NotImplementedError: If extracted frame-variant metadata contains unexpected keys or expected keys for which
            we do not have a custom extraction implementation.

    Args:
        tiff_path: The path to the TIFF stack to process.
        first_frame_number: The position (number) of the first frame stored in the stack, relative to the overall

        remove_sources: Determines whether to remove original TIFF stacks after processing.
        verify_integrity: Determines whether to verify the integrity of compressed data against the source data.

    This function is used as a preprocessing step for mesoscope-acquired data that optimizes the size of raw images for
    long-term storage and streaming over the network. To do so, all stacks are re-encoded using LERC scheme, which
    achieves ~70% compression ratio, compared to the original frame stacks obtained from the mesoscope. Additionally,
    this function also extracts frame-variant and frame-invariant ScanImage metadata from raw stacks and saves it as
    efficiently encoded JSON (.json) and compressed numpy archive (.npz) files to minimize disk space usage.

    Notes:
        This function is specifically calibrated to work with TIFF stacks produced by the ScanImage matlab software.
        Critically, these stacks are named using '_' to separate acquisition and stack number from the rest of the
        file name, and the stack number is always found last, e.g.: 'Tyche-A7_2022_01_25_1__00001_00067.tif'. If the
        input TIFF files do not follow this naming convention, the function will not process them. Similarly, if the
        stacks do not contain ScanImage metadata, they will be excluded from processing.

        To optimize runtime efficiency, this function employs multiple processes to work with multiple TIFFs at the
        same time. Given the overall size of each image dataset, this function can run out of RAM if it is allowed to
        operate on the entire folder at the same time. To prevent this, disable verification, use fewer processes, or
        combine both methods.

        image_directory: The directory containing the multi-frame TIFF stacks. Usually, this is the raw_data directory
            of the project-animal-session hierarchy.
        output_directory: The path to the directory where to save processed (compressed) TIFF stacks.
        ops_path: The path to the ops.json file that should be created by this function. This file is used during
            suite2p registration (processing) of the mesoscope data.
        frame_invariant_metadata_path: The path to the metadata.json file that stores frame-invariant metadata. This
            metadata is the same across the stacks and frames of the same session. Currently, this data is not used for
            further processing, but it is preserved in case it is ever necessary in the future.
        frame_variant_metadata_path: The path to the metadata.npz file that stores frame-variant metadata for each frame
            acquired during the same session. Similar to frame-invariant metadata, this file is not use for further
            processing at this time.
        num_processes: The maximum number of processes to use while processing the directory. Each process is used to
            compress a stack of TIFF files in parallel.
        remove_sources: Determines whether to remove the original TIFF files after they have been processed.
        batch: Determines whether the function is called as part of batch-processing multiple directories. This is used
            to optimize progress reporting to avoid cluttering the terminal window.
        verify_integrity: Determines whether to verify the integrity of compressed data against the source data.
            The conversion does not alter the source data, so it is usually safe to disable this option, as the chance
            of compromising the data is negligible. Note, enabling this function doubles the RAM used by each parallel
            worker spawned by this function.
