class _MesoscopeExperiment:
    """The base class for all mesoscope experiment runtimes.

    This class provides methods for conducting experiments using the Mesoscope-VR system. It abstracts most
    low-level interactions with the VR system and the mesoscope via a simple high-level state API.

    Notes:
        Calling this initializer only instantiates a minimal subset of all Mesoscope-VR assets. Use the start() method
        before issuing other commands to properly initialize all required runtime assets and remote processes.

        This class statically reserves the id code '1' to label its log entries. Make sure no other Ataraxis class, such
        as MicroControllerInterface or VideoSystem, uses this id code.

    Args:
        experiment_configuration: An initialized MesoscopeExperimentConfiguration instance that specifies experiment
            configuration and runtime sequence.
        session_data: An initialized SessionData instance used to control the flow of data during acquisition and
            preprocessing. Each instance is initialized for the specific project, animal, and session combination for
            which the data is acquired.
        session_descriptor: A partially initialized MesoscopeExperimentDescriptor instance. This instance is used to
            store session-specific information in a human-readable format.

    Attributes:
        _state_map: Maps the integer state-codes used to represent VR system states to human-readable string-names.
        _started: Tracks whether the VR system and experiment runtime are currently running.
        descriptor: Stores the session descriptor instance of the managed session.
        _experiment_configuration: Stores the MesoscopeExperimentConfiguration instance of the managed session.
        _session_data: Stores the SessionData instance of the managed session.
        _mesoscope_data: Stores the MesoscopeData instance of the managed session.
        _vr_state: Stores the current state of the VR system. The MesoscopeExperiment updates this value whenever it is
            instructed to change the VR system state.
        _experiment_state: Stores the user-defined experiment state. Experiment states are defined by the user and
            are expected to have unique meaning for each project and, potentially, experiment.
        _source_id: Stores the unique identifier code for this class instance. The identifier is used to mark log
            entries made by this class instance and has to be unique across all sources that log data at the same time,
            such as MicroControllerInterfaces and VideoSystems.
        _timestamp_timer: A PrecisionTimer instance used to timestamp log entries generated by the class instance.
        _logger: A DataLogger instance that collects behavior log data from all sources: microcontrollers, video
            cameras, and the MesoscopeExperiment instance.
        _microcontrollers: Stores the MicroControllerInterfaces instance that interfaces with all MicroController
            devices used during runtime.
        _cameras: Stores the VideoSystems instance that interfaces with video systems (cameras) used during
            runtime.
        _zaber_motors: Stores the ZaberMotors class instance that interfaces with HeadBar, LickPort, and Wheel motors.

    The run training consists of making the animal run on the wheel with a desired speed, in centimeters per second,
    maintained for the desired duration of time, in seconds. Each time the animal satisfies the speed and duration
    thresholds, it receives 5 uL of water reward, and the speed and durations trackers reset for the next training
    'epoch'. Each time the animal receives 'increase_threshold' of water, the speed and duration thresholds increase to
    make the task progressively more challenging. The training continues either until the training time exceeds the
    'maximum_training_time', or the animal receives the 'maximum_water_volume' of water, whichever happens earlier.

    Notes:
        During runtime, it is possible to manually increase or decrease both thresholds via 'ESC' and arrow keys. The
        speed and duration thresholds are limited to a minimum of 0.1 cm/s and 0.05 s and a maximum of 20 cm/s and

        initial_duration_threshold: The initial duration threshold, in seconds, that the animal must maintain
            above-threshold running speed to receive water rewards.
        speed_increase_step: The step size, in centimeters per second, by which to increase the speed threshold each
            time the animal receives 'increase_threshold' milliliters of water.
        duration_increase_step: The step size, in seconds, by which to increase the duration threshold each time the

        increase_threshold: The volume of water received by the animal, in milliliters, after which the speed and
            duration thresholds are increased by one step. Note, the animal will at most get 'maximum_water_volume' of
            water, so this parameter effectively controls how many increases will be made during runtime, assuming the

        maximum_water_volume: The maximum volume of water, in milliliters, that can be delivered during this runtime.
        maximum_training_time: The maximum time, in minutes, to run the training.
        maximum_idle_time: The maximum time, in seconds, the animal's speed can be below the speed threshold to
            still receive water rewards. This parameter is designed to help animals with a distinct 'step' pattern to
            not lose water rewards due to taking many large steps, rather than continuously running at a stable speed.

    """Encapsulates the logic used to run experiments via the Mesoscope-VR system.

    This function can be used to execute any valid experiment using the Mesoscope-VR system. Each experiment should be
    broken into one or more experiment states (phases), such as 'baseline', 'task' and 'cooldown'. Furthermore, each
    experiment state can use one or more VR system states. Currently, the VR system has two states: rest (1) and run
    (2). The states are used to broadly configure the Mesoscope-VR system, and they determine which systems are active
    and what data is collected (see library ReadMe for more details on VR states).

    Primarily, this function is concerned with iterating over the states stored inside the experiment_state_sequence
    tuple. Each experiment and VR state combination is maintained for the requested duration of seconds. Once all states
    have been executed, the experiment runtime ends. Under this design pattern, each experiment is conceptualized as
    a sequence of states.

    Notes:
        During experiment runtimes, the task logic and the Virtual Reality world are resolved via the Unity game engine.
        This function itself does not resolve the task logic, it is only concerned with iterating over experiment
        states, controlling the VR system, and monitoring user command issued via keyboard.

        Similar to all other runtime functions, this function contains all necessary bindings to set up, execute, and
        terminate an experiment runtime. Custom projects should implement a cli that calls this function with
        project-specific parameters.
